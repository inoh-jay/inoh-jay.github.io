I resigned my first company in 2023 where I had been for 9 years.

Then I joined an IT bootcamp and graduated in 2024.

After graduation, I joined the second IT company and I resigned in 2025.

I have been consistently doing things the following:

For health, I dieted and jogged every lunchtime.

For development skills, I learned new technologies regularly.

For following the latest technology trends, I attended some conferences such as KSUG and Woowacon.

To stabilize financial, I checked cash flow regularly and started to invest in stocks to avoid inflation.

For housing stability, I studied policies to qualify for better lease terms.

For family and memories, I went some short and long trips.

After all, I wanted to make good habits.

I've not been keeping these perfectly. but I feel like I'm improving every day.
